= `PalmSens.Core.dll`

The PalmSens SDK contains the following libraries and projects:

. *PalmSens.Core.dll & PalmSens.Core.Windows.BLE.dll*
+
These libraries contain the namespaces with all the necessary files for
using PalmSens/EmStat/Nexus/Sensit devices in your software.

** `PalmSens`: All necessary classes and functions for performing
measurements and doing analysis with PalmSens, EmStat, Sensit or Nexus.
** `PalmSens.Comm`: For Serial, USB, TCP, Bluetooth (Classic/Low Energy)
communication with instruments.
** `PalmSens.DataFiles`: For saving and loading method and data files.
** `PalmSens.Devices`: For handling communications and device
capabilities.
** `PalmSens.Techniques`: Contains all measurement techniques.
** `PalmSens.Units`: Contains a collection of units used by these

The basis for handling measurements is the `PalmSens.Measurement` class, or the `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.Data.SimpleMeasurement` class when using the simplified wrapper.

The measurement class contains all classes, functions, and parameters necessary for performing a measurement with a _PalmSens_ or _EmStat_ instrument.
It has one method and can contain multiple curves.
Curves are a representation of the data in the measurement used for plotting
and analysis.
