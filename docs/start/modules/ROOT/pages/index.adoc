== Which SDK should you use?

For new projects, we recommend using xref:python:ROOT:index.adoc[PyPalmSens] for research, data analysis and prototyping, and the xref:maui:ROOT:index.adoc[.NET MAUI SDK] for native, cross-platform app development targeting Windows, Android, and iOS.
Both of these SDKs are actively developed and will be first to receive new features, updates, and fixes.

For existing codebases already using xref:matlab:ROOT:index.adoc[Matlab], xref:labview:ROOT:index.adoc[LabView], xref:winforms:ROOT:index.adoc[WinForms], or xref:wpf:ROOT:index.adoc[WPF], we maintain the other SDKs.
These SDKs will continue to receive occasional bug fixes but are no longer under active development.
