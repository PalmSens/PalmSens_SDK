== Which SDK should you use?

For new projects, we recommend using xref:python:ROOT:index.adoc[PyPalmSens] for research, data analysis and prototyping, and the xref:maui:ROOT:index.adoc[.NET MAUI SDK] for native, cross-platform application development targeting Windows, Android, and iOS.
Both of these SDKs are actively maintained and will continue to receive new features and updates.

For existing codebases, we support the xref:matlab:ROOT:index.adoc[Matlab SDK], xref:labview:ROOT:index.adoc[LabView SDK], xref:winforms:ROOT:index.adoc[WinForms SDK], xref:wpf:ROOT:index.adoc[WPF SDK].
These SDKs will continue to receive occasional bug fixes but are no longer under active development.
