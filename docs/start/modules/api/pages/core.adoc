= PalmSens.Core

The PalmSens SDK is built on the following libraries and projects:

* `PalmSens.Core`
* `PalmSens.Core.Windows`

These libraries are provided as dlls or nuget packages and contain the namespaces with all the necessary files for using PalmSens/EmStat devices in your software.

* `PalmSens`: All necessary classes and functions for performing measurements and doing analysis with PalmSens or EmStat.
* `PalmSens.Comm`: For Serial, USB or TCP communication with PalmSens or EmStat
* `PalmSens.DataFiles`: For saving and loading method and data files
* `PalmSens.Devices`: For handling communications and device capabilities
* `PalmSens.Techniques`: Contains all measurement techniques for PalmSens and EmStat
* `PalmSens.Units`: Contains a collection of units used by these libraries

The basis for handling measurements is the `PalmSens.Measurement` class, or the `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.Data.SimpleMeasurement` class when using the simplified wrapper.

The measurement class contains all classes, functions, and parameters necessary for performing a measurement with a _PalmSens_ or _EmStat_ instrument.
A `Measurement` has one associated method and can contain multiple curves.
Curves are a representation of the data in the measurement used for plotting and analysis.

classes:
