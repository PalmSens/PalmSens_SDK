== Contents of the PalmSens SDK

The PalmSens SDK contains the following libraries and projects:

. *PalmSens.Core.dll & PalmSens.Core.Windows.BLE.dll*
+
These libraries contain the namespaces with all the necessary files for
using PalmSens/EmStat/Nexus/Sensit devices in your software.

** `PalmSens`: All necessary classes and functions for performing
measurements and doing analysis with PalmSens, EmStat, Sensit or Nexus.
** `PalmSens.Comm`: For Serial, USB, TCP, Bluetooth (Classic/Low Energy)
communication with instruments.
** `PalmSens.DataFiles`: For saving and loading method and data files.
** `PalmSens.Devices`: For handling communications and device
capabilities.
** `PalmSens.Techniques`: Contains all measurement techniques.
** `PalmSens.Units`: Contains a collection of units used by these
libraries.nsrt

. *pspython*
+
A python wrapper for the .NET libraries above.

** `pspyinstruments.py`: Contains the functions to scan for available
instruments and the InstrumentManager class used to control the
PalmSens, EmStat, Sensit or Nexus instruments.
** `pspydata.py`: Defines the measurements and curves classes
** `pspyfiles.py`: For saving/loading session and method files
** `pspymethods.py`: Work in progress, helper functions to create methods
