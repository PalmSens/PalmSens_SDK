= PyPalmSens: Python SDK for PalmSens devices

PyPalmSens is a Python library for automating electrochemistry experiments with your PalmSens instruments.
PyPalmSens is built on top of the xref:ROOT:index.adoc[PalmSens .NET libraries].
It provides an intuitive Python API, making it straightforward to integrate into your Python workflows.

With PyPalmSens, you can:

- Connect to one or more instruments/channels
- Automate electrochemistry measurements
- Access and process measured data
- Analyze and manipulate data
- Perform peak detection
- Do Equivalent Circuit Fitting on impedance data
- Manually control of the cell
- Read and write method and data files

To install:

```bash
pip install pypalmsens
```

PyPalmSens requires the .NET runtime to be installed.
For specific installation instructions for your platform, see xref:installation.adoc[]

== Getting started

The following example shows how to set up and measure a simple chronoamperometry experiment:

[source,python]
----
>>> import pypalmsens

>>> method = pypalmsens.ChronoAmperometryParameters(
...     interval_time=0.01,
...     potential=1.0,
...     run_time=10.0,
... )

>>> with pypalmsens.connect() as manager:  # <1>
...     measurement = manager.measure(method)
----
<1> `connect()` tries to connect to the first instrument it finds

The following example shows how to discover devices and manually read out the current.

[source,python]
----
>>> import pypalmsens

>>> instruments = pypalmsens.discover()

>>> with pypalmsens.connect(device=instruments[0]) as manager:
...     manager.set_cell(True)
...     manager.set_potential(1)
...     manager.set_current_range(pypalmsens.config.CURRENT_RANGE.cr_1_mA)
...
...     current = manager.read_current()
...     print(f'{current=} µA')
...
...     manager.set_cell(False)
current=92.8065 µA
----

Analyze a previous measurement with https://pandas.pydata.org/[pandas]:

[source,python]
----
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from pypalmsens import load_session_file

>>> measurements = load_session_file('Demo CV DPV EIS IS-C electrode.pssession')

>>> frames = []
>>> frame_names = []

>>> for measurement in measurements:
...     frames.append(measurement.dataset.to_dataframe())  # <1>
...     frame_names.append(measurement.title)

>>> df = pd.concat(frames, keys=frame_names)
>>> print(df)
----
<1> Extract all arrays from the dataset into a https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html[pandas dataframe].
