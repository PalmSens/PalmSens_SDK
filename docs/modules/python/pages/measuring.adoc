= Connecting and Measuring

The following chapter details how to connect to a device, read data from the device, manually controlling the potential, run measurements on the device and finally how to properly close a connection to a device.

The `pspyinstruments.py` script in the `pspython` module contains all the relevant functions for discovering and controlling instruments. 
The `InstrumentManager` and `InstrumentManagerAsync` class are wrappers around our .NET libraries which make it possible to connect to and control PalmSens instruments from Python.

== Connecting to a device

The following example shows how to get a list of all available devices, and how to connect to one of the discovered devices that.

[source,python]
----
available_instruments = pspyinstruments.discover_instruments()

manager = pspyinstruments.InstrumentManager()

manager.connect(available_instruments[0])
----

Currently the `pspython` module supports discovering instruments connected via FTDI, serial (usbcdc/com), and Bluetooth (classic/low energy). By default scanning with Bluetooth is disabled.

== Manually controlling the device

Depending on your device’s capabilities it can be used to set a potential/current and to switch current ranges. 
The potential can be set manually in potentiostatic mode and the current can be set in galvanostatic mode. 
The following example show how to manually set a potential, for more examples refer to the `ManualControlExample` and `ManualControlExampleAsync` scripts included with the SDK.

[source,python]
----
manager.set_potential(1)
----

== Measuring

Starting a measurement is done by sending method parameters to a PalmSens/Nexus/EmStat/Sensit device. 
The `InstrumentManager` measure function returns a `Measurement` and also supports keeping a reference to the underlying .NET object.
For more information please refer to xref:core_dll.adoc[].

The following example runs a chronoamperometry measurement on an instrument.

[source,python]
----
method = pspymethods.chronoamperometry(interval_time=0.01, e=1.0,
run_time=10.0)

measurement = manager.measure(method)
----

It is possible to process measurement results in real-time by specifying a callback on the `InstrumentManager`/`InstrumentManagerAsync` either by providing it as an override when it is created using the `new_data_callback` argument:

[source,python]
----
def new_data_callback(new_data):
    for point in new_data:
        print(point)

manager = pspyinstruments.InstrumentManager(
    new_data_callback=new_data_callback
)
----

or by setting it on the `InstrumentManager`’s new_data_callback field.

[source,python]
----
manager.new_data_callback = stream_to_csv_callback(csv_writer)
----

The callback is passed a collection of points that have been added since the last time it was called. 
Points contain a dictionary with the following information:

=== Non-impedimetric techniques

Techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry or chronopotentiometry return a dictionary containing the following values:

* `index`: the index of the point
* `x`, `x_unit` and `x_type`: depending on the technique this
will be:
** Time in seconds for amperometry and potentiometry techniques that do
not specify a begin and an end potential
** Potential in volts for voltammetry techniques such as linear sweep,
cyclic and square-wave voltammetry
** Current in micro amperes for linear sweep potentiometry
* `y`, `y_unit` and `y_type`: depending on the techniques this
will be:
** Current in micro amperes for all potentiometric techniques such as
linear sweep and cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry and multistep
amperometry
** Potential in volts for all galvanostatic techniques such as
chronopotentiometry and linear sweep potentiometry

=== Impedimetric techniques

The exception are (galvanostatic/) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These techniques return the following:

* `frequency`: the applied frequency of the sample in hertz
* `z_re`: the real impedance in ohms
* `z_im`: the imaginary impedance in ohms

[CAUTION]
.Mains Frequency
====
To eliminate noise induced by other electrical appliances it is highly recommended to set your regional mains frequency (50/60 Hz) in the static property `PalmSens.Method.PowerFreq`.

== MethodSCRIPT™

The MethodSCRIPT™ scripting language is designed to integrate our OEM potentiostat (modules) effortlessly in your hardware setup or product.

MethodSCRIPT™ allows developers to program a human-readable script directly into the potentiostat module by means of a serial (TTL) connection. 
The simple script language allows for running all supported electrochemical techniques and makes it easy to combine different measurements and other tasks.

More script features include:

* Use of variables
* (Nested) loops
* Logging results to an SD card
* Digital I/O for example for waiting for an external trigger
* Reading auxiliary values like pH or temperature
* Going to sleep or hibernate mode

See the https://www.palmsens.com/methodscript[MethodSCRIPT™ documentation] for more information.

=== Sandbox Measurements

PSTrace includes an option to make use MethodSCRIPT™ Sandbox to write and run scripts. 
This is a great place to test MethodSCRIPT™ measurements to see what the result would be.
That script can then be used in the MethodScriptSandbox technique in the SDK as demonstrated below.

=== Disconnecting from the device

The InstrumentManager disconnect function disconnects from the device freeing it up for other things to connect to it.

[source,python]
----
manager.disconnect()
----
