* .NET Runtime 9.0 or newer, see this https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux[link] for more information
  Typically this is called something like `dotnet-runtime-9.0` in your system's package manager.
* Optional: FTDI d2xx drivers available on https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/[the ftdi website].

  If you do not use them it is recommended to disable scanning for FTDI devices.

  ```python
  available_instruments = discover_instruments(ftdi=False)
  ```

== (Optional) Create a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code

https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code] in combination with the Python, Python Debugger and Pylance extensions offer an easy command to create a virtual environment and load the python dependencies. See the https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments[VSCode documentation
] for how to set this up.
