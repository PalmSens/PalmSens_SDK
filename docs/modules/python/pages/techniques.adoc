= Techniques

This page contains a listing of all available techniques in PyPalmSens.

For example to set up a CV experiment:

[source,python]
----
import pypalmsens

method = pypalmsens.CyclicVoltammetry(
    begin_potential = -1,
    vertex1_potential = -1,
    vertex2_potential = 1,
    step_potential = 0.25,
    scanrate = 5,
    n_scans = 2,
    current_ranges = pypalmsens.settings.CurrentRanges(
        max = pypalmsens.settings.CURRENT_RANGE.cr_1_mA,
        min = pypalmsens.settings.CURRENT_RANGE.cr_100_nA,
        start = pypalmsens.settings.CURRENT_RANGE.cr_100_uA,
    ),
)

Shared settings
====
Many configuration settings are shared between methods, like the current ranges above
or _versus OCP_ or _trigger_ settings. These are listed in xref:settings.adoc[].
