[NOTE]
.Broken dependency error when using the SDK
====
When you have downloaded the SDK and extract its contents Windows will
have blocked the required .NET library .dll files. When you try to
execute anything in the SDK that uses these libraries you will get an
error like this.

To prevent this error you will need to manually unblock the PalmSens SDK
for LabVIEW.zip file before unpacking its contents. To do this go to
right click on the zip file and select Properties. Then click on the
Unblock checkbox and click on OK.

If this does not resolve the issue you may need to do this for each file
in the PalmSens\Libraries subfolder.
