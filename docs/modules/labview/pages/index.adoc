== SDK overview

The PalmSens SDK contains the following .NET libraries and LabVIEW
classes, controls and Vis in the PalmSens folder:

Libraries Folder::
Contains all the necessary .NET libraries.
Labview directly interfaces with the classes and functions defined in these libraries.

PalmSens LabVIEW class::

    Class that implements the basic features required to use our instruments
    in LabVIEW.

    * `Initialise`: Initialises the class and .NET libraries.
    * `Dispose`: Frees up memory used by .NET libraries.
    * `ListInstruments`: Returns an array of the available instruments.
    * `Connect`: Connects to the specified instrument.
    * `Disconnect`: Disconnects from the connected instrument.
    * `Measure`: Performs a measurement.
    * `AbortMeasurement`: Aborts the current measurement

`MeasurementResults` and `LiveCurveResults` controls::
Type definitions for the in and outputs of the Measure function.

Event Callback Vis::
VIs used by the Measure function to receive data from .NET events.

== Example programs
