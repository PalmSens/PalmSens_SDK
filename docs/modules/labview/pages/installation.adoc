= Installation

This page takes you through setting up the SDK for your LabVIEW project.

== Requirements

To discover our instruments and use our SDK libraries our drivers and
the .NET/C++ runtimes need to be installed. We highly recommend
installing PSTrace or MultiTrace as this installs all the required
dependencies.

The following diagram shows the inheritance structure of the Method
classes:

== Adding the PalmSens folder

To add the SDK to a new or existing LabVIEW project add the PalmSens
folder. Right click on the My Computer entry in the Project Explorer, go
to Add and select Folder. Both the Snapshot and Auto-populating options
will work.

== Broken dependency error when using the SDK

When you have downloaded the SDK and extract its contents Windows will
have blocked the required .NET library .dll files. When you try to
execute anything in the SDK that uses these libraries you will get an
error like this.

To prevent this error you will need to manually unblock the PalmSens SDK
for LabVIEW.zip file before unpacking its contents. To do this go to
right click on the zip file and select Properties. Then click on the
Unblock checkbox and click on OK.

If this does not resolve the issue you may need to do this for each file
in the PalmSens\Libraries subfolder.
