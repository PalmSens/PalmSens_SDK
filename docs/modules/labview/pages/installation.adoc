= Installation
:experimental: true

This page takes you through setting up the SDK for your LabVIEW project.

== Requirements

To discover our instruments and use our SDK libraries our drivers and the .NET/C++ runtimes need to be installed.
We highly recommend installing PSTrace or MultiTrace as this installs all the required dependencies.

== Adding the PalmSens folder

To add the SDK to a new or existing LabVIEW project add the PalmSens folder.
In the _Project Explorer_, right click on the menu:My Computer[Add > Folder (...)].
Both the menu:Folder (Snapshot)[] and menu:Folder (Auto-populating)[] options will work.

== Broken dependency error when using the SDK

When you download the SDK and extract its contents Windows blocks the required .NET library .dll files.
Executing anything in the SDK that uses these libraries produces an error like this.

To prevent this error you will need to manually unblock the PalmSens SDK for LabVIEW.zip file before unpacking its contents.
To do this go to menu:right click on the zip file[Properties].
Then click on the btn:[Unblock] checkbox and click on btn:[OK].

If this does not resolve the issue you may need to do this for each file in the `PalmSens\Libraries` subfolder.
