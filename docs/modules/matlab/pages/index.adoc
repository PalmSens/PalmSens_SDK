| **Control your PalmSens instrument using MATLAB**

Connect to your PalmSens instrument, receive data and plot the results, with a graphical user interface in MATLAB.
After selecting the electrochemical technique to use, you can adjust the parameters and start a measurement.

| **Import experimental results from PSTrace directly into MATLAB**

You can import your saved data from PSTrace in MATLAB directly.
Use the PSTrace software to set-up and run your experiments with PalmSens instruments and use MATLAB for your advanced data analyses.

== Installation

To use the matlab SDK, download the latest https://github.com/palmsens/palmsens_sdk/releases[release here].
Unzip and load the directory in Matlab.

== Examples

The SDK contains the following examples and functions aimed to help you with using PalmSens and Emstat devices in Matlab.

`ConnnectionExample.m`:: Detailed explanation on how to detect and connect to your device.
`MethodExample.m`:: Detailed explanation on how to load, edit and create new methods (methods are used to specify technique and the settings for a measurment).
`ImportSessionExample.m`:: Detailed explanation on how to import and view measurements from a `.pssession` file created with PSTrace 5.x or MultiTrace 4.x.
`MeasurementExample.m`:: Detailed explanation on how to perform a measurement, specified in a method, with a connected PalmSens or Emstat device.
`EquivalentCircuitFitExample.m`:: An example of equivalent circuit fitting
`GUIExample.m`:: An example of a Matlab user interface for performing measurements with your device.
`ManualControlExample.m`:: An example of a Maltab user interface for manual control of your device.
`MultiChannelMeasurementLoopExample.m`:: An example of connecting to and running measurements on multiple instruments/channels.

== Functions

`LoadPSSDK.m`:: Loads the PalmSens Matlab SDK.
`LoadMethod.m`:: Loads a method from a *.psmethod file.
`NewMethod.m`:: Creates a new method.
`SaveMethod.m`:: Saves a method.
`LoadSession.m`:: Load (a) measurement(s) from a *.pssession file.
`GetConnectedDevices.m`:: Returns a list of connected PalmSens and Emstat devices.
`OpenConnection.m`:: Opens a connection to a device.
`MultiChannelMeasurementLoopHelper.m`:: Waits for multiple instruments to finish their measurements

== Classes

`Measurement.m`:: Returns data measured by a device as a variable, message in the command window and/or a plot in a figure.
`MeasurementGUI.m`:: Version of the Measurement.m class that can be used with a Matlab GUIDE user interface.
`MultiChannelMeasurement.m`:: Used for running when connected to multiple instruments simultaneaously, please refer to the `MultiChannelMeasurementLoopExample`
`EquivalentCircuitFit.m`:: Handles the equivalent circuit fitting using the PalmSens.Core.Matlab.dll
