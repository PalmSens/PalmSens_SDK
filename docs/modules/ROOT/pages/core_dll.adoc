= `PalmSens.Core.dll`

The basis for handling measurements is the `PalmSens.Measurement` class, or the `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.Data.SimpleMeasurement` class when using the simplified wrapper.

The measurement class contains all classes, functions, and parameters necessary for performing a measurement with a _PalmSens_ or _EmStat_ instrument.
It has one method and can contain multiple curves.
Curves are a representation of the data in the measurement used for plotting
and analysis.
