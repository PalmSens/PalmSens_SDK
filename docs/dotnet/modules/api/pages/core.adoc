= PalmSens.Core

The most relevant parts of the `PalmSens.Core` library:

PalmSens::
All necessary classes and functions for performing measurements and doing analysis with PalmSens or EmStat.

PalmSens.Comm::
For Serial, USB or TCP communication with PalmSens or EmStat

PalmSens.DataFiles::
For saving and loading method and data files

PalmSens.Devices::
For handling communications and device capabilities

PalmSens.Techniques::
Contains all measurement techniques for PalmSens and EmStat.
See xref:dotnet:ROOT:techniques.adoc[this page] for more information.

PalmSens.Units::
Contains a collection of units used by these libraries

The basis for handling measurements is the `PalmSens.Measurement` class, or the `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.Data.SimpleMeasurement` class intthe simplified wrapper.

The measurement class contains all classes, functions, and parameters necessary for performing a measurement with a _PalmSens_ or _EmStat_ instrument.

A `Measurement` has one associated method and can contain multiple curves.
Curves are a representation of the data in the measurement used for plotting and analysis.
