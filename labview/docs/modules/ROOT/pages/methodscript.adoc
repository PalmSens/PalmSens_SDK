= MethodSCRIPT™
:experimental: true

The MethodSCRIPT™ scripting language is designed to integrate PalmSens OEM potentiostat (modules) effortlessly in your hardware setup or product.

MethodSCRIPT™ allows developers to program a human-readable script directly into the potentiostat module by means of a serial (TTL) connection.
The simple script language allows for running all supported electrochemical techniques and makes it easy to combine different measurements and other tasks.

More script features include:

* Use of variables
* (Nested) loops
* Logging results to an SD card
* Digital I/O for example for waiting for an external trigger
* Reading auxiliary values like pH or temperature
* Going to sleep or hibernate mode

== Sandbox Measurements

PSTrace includes an option to make use MethodSCRIPT™ Sandbox to write and run scripts.
This is a great place to test MethodSCRIPT™ measurements to see what the result would be.
That script can then be used in the _MethodScriptSandbox_ technique in the SDK as demonstrated below.

The xref:index.adoc#example_methodscript[MethodSCRIPTExample VI] demonstrates how to run this measurement on a compatible instrument, _i.e._ the Sensit, EmStat Pico and EmStat4 series instruments.

`SandboxMeasurements` parse and store the variables sent in `pcks`.
Sets of x and y values are generated automatically for each `meas_loop` that defines a `pck` with two or more variables, scripts with multiple `meas_loop` will generate sets.
The first variable in the pck will be set as the x-axis and a set is created for each subsequent variable in the `pck`.
Please note that to plot data versus time you will need to add a variable with the time to the pck.

In the example above two sets of x and y values will be generated.
