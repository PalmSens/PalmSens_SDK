= Measuring
:experimental: true

Start a measurement by sending method parameters to a PalmSens/EmStat device.

[[create_method]]
== Creating a method

To run a measurement on your instrument, create an instance of a method that defines the parameters for the technique to run.
See the xref:dotnet:ROOT:techniques.adoc[.NET api reference] for an overview of all techniques and their respective parameters.

To create an instance of a method in LabVIEW add a .NET constructor node
to your block diagram.

image::create_method_1.png[Add a .NET constructor node]

This will open Select .NET Constructor window. Drag the node to your block diagram.

1. Open the node and click btn:[Browse..].
2. Navigate to the PalmSens/Libraries folder included with the SDK and select the `PalmSens.Core.dll`
3. Click on btn:[OK].

image::create_method_2.png[Browse for `PalmSens.Core.dll`]

Alternatively you can select the `PalmSens.Core` Assembly from the dropdown list in the .NET Constructor Window.

image::create_method_3.png[Select `PalmSens.Core` Assembly]

Then double-click on the menu:PalmSens.Techniques[] near the bottom of the list to expand it.

image::create_method_4.png[Select `PalmSens.Techniques` item]

Select the technique you want to run and click on btn:[OK].
See the xref:dotnet:ROOT:techniques.adoc[.NET API reference] and the PSTrace help documentation for more information.
This example uses the _Linear Sweep Voltammetry_ technique.

image::create_method_5.png[Select LinearSweep technique]

To define the parameters for a technique right-click on the constructor node, go to menu:Create[Property for PalmSens.Techniques Class > EquilibrationTime] or any other parameter you want to set.
The xref:dotnet:ROOT:techniques.adoc[.NET API reference] lists the relevant parameters for each technique.

image::create_method_6.png[Select EquilibrationTime property]

Connect the property to the constructor node and change it to write by menu:right click[Change All To Write].

image::create_method_7.png[Change all to write]

Then create a constant by menu:right-clicking on the node[Create Constant] and update the value.

== Current/Potential Ranges

Current and potential ranges are respectively stored in the `Ranging` and `RangingPotential` parameters. To set the minimum, maximum, and starting range you will need to create an instances of the current/potential ranges by adding .NET constructor nodes.

image::current_ranges_1.png[Select .NET constructor]

1. Select the menu:PalmSens.Core(...)[] assembly in the _Select .NET Constructor_ window
2. List the current and potential objects by double-clicking on menu:PalmSens[].

image::current_ranges_2.png[Select CurrentRange constructor]

1. Select menu:CurrentRange[CurrentRange(CurrentRanges cr)]
2. Click btn:[OK]

To define a potential range, press menu:PotentialRange[PotentialRange(PotentialRanges pr)] instead.

image::current_ranges_3.png[Set the current range to cr1uA]

Add a constant value to the `cr`/`pr` node and select the range from the list.
These current ranges can then be set to the `Ranging`/`RangingPotential` `Maximum`, `Minimum`, and `Start` parameters.

== Mains Frequency

To eliminate noise induced by other electrical appliances it is highly recommended to set your regional mains frequency (50/60 Hz) in the static property `PalmSens.Method.PowerFreq`.
Add a .NET property node to your Block Diagram.

[cols=".^a,.^a", frame=none, grid=none]
|===
| image::mains_frequency_1.png[Select PalmSens.Core in the Select Object From Assembly window]
| image::mains_frequency_2.png[Select Method in the Select Object From Assembly window]
|===

1. Select the menu:PalmSens.Core(...)[] assembly in the _Select .NET Constructor_ window
2. List the current and potential objects by double-clicking on menu:PalmSens[].
3. Select menu:Method[]
4. In the Block Diagram, click on the property and select menu:PowerFreq[].
5. Set the value to integer 50 or 60

[cols=".^a,.^a", frame=none, grid=none]

== Running a measurement

To run a measurement you must be xref:connecting.adoc#connect_instrument[connected to an instrument], and need an xref:create_method[instance of a method]
To run a measurent drag and drop the menu:Measure[] function VI from the PalmSens lvclass into your block diagram and connect it to the PalmSens class.

image::measuring_1.png[Add measure function to block diagram]

Make sure to connect the method to the input.
The output can be stored in an indicator, the easiest way to view the results is to right click on the ouput node and select create indicator.
The type of the output is defined in `MeasurementResults.ctl`, it is a set of x and y values with strings for the name and units.

Similar to PSTrace, a linear sweep voltammetry measurement will give you one set of current and potential values.
A cyclic voltammetry measurement will give you multiple sets of current and potential values corresponding to the amount of scans.
And, a chronopotentiometry / amperometric detection measurement will give you a set of current and time values.
When extra values are also recorded these will return as additional sets of x and y values and the same applies to multiplexer scan results.

[TIP]
.Blocking behavior of Measure function
====
The menu:Measure[] function will block the VI until the measurement is complete, for more information on this refer to xref:dotnet:ROOT:techniques.adoc[] and the xref:index.adoc#example_basicui[BasicUIExample VI]`.
====

== Live interaction

When a measurement is running the VI or measurement loop will be blocked until the measurement is done.
This section and the xref:index.adoc#example_basicui[BasicUIExample VI] show how to work around this to plot/process results in real-time and abort a running measurement.

=== Visualization

The menu:Measure[] function VI has an input terminal to which you can connect a reference to an indicator of the cluster defined in the `LiveCurveResult.ctl` type definition.
You can add this by dragging and dropping the menu:LiveCurveResult.ctl[] on to your front panel.

[cols=".^a,.^a", frame=none, grid=none]
|===
| image::live_curve_1.png[Live curve result front panel]
| image::live_curve_2.png[Create and select reference]
|===

1. Go to the indicator for the `LiveCurveResult` in the block diagram.
2. menu:Right click on it[Create > `Reference`]. The resulting reference can then be connected to the `Measure` function VI.

image::live_curve_3.png[Connect reference to Measure function]

The values of the `LiveCurveResult` will be updated during while the measurement is running and LabVIEW receives a signal for each of these updates.
The event block allows you to execute something each time a signal is received.
To receive measurement data in real-time the _Event Structure_ should be placed inside a loop.

[cols=".^a,.^a", frame=none, grid=none]
|===
| image::live_curve_4.png[Select Event Structure]
| image::live_curve_5.png[Place event structure inside a loop]
|===

The _Event Structure_ has a timeout event setup by default.
If you want to use the loop containing the _Event Structure_ for other things, we highly recommended to define the timeout of the _Event Structure_ in the top left corner.

[cols=".^a,.^a", frame=none, grid=none]
|===
| image::live_curve_6.png[Add event case]
| image::live_curve_7.png[Add event on value change]
|===

1. Next you will need to add an _Event Case_ to the _Event Structure_.
2. In the _Edit Event_ window, select menu:Event Sources[LiveCurveResult > All Elements]
3. Select menu:Events[Value Change]
4. Click on btn:[OK].

image::live_curve_8.png[Example live curve result loop]

The xref:index.adoc#example_basicui[BasicUIExample VI] uses this _Event Structure_ to update the plot.

image::live_curve_9.png[Visualization and Measure functions in different loops]

To be able to visualize/process these results the _Measure_ function VI
and event structure cannot be in the same loop.

=== Abort a measurement

To add the functionality of aborting a running measurement, drag and drop
the menu:AbortMeasurement[] function VI from the PalmSens lvclass into your
block diagram.

image::measurement_abort.png[Two different loops for measure and abort]

Make sure that the menu:AbortMeasurement[] function VI and the `Measure` function VI are placed in separate loops.
Otherwise, the most likely scenario will be that LabVIEW will postpone executing the abort command until after the measurement is finished.
This also applies applies to the `Disconnect` and `Dispose` function VI commands and any other UI or blocks that you want to be able to execute in parallel to a measurement.
