See [the installation guidelines](https://palmsens.github.io/PalmSens_SDK/palmsens-sdk/labview/installation.html) for more information.

## SDK overview

The PalmSens SDK contains the following .NET libraries and LabVIEW
classes, controls and Vis in the PalmSens folder:

- Libraries Folder: Contains all the necessary .NET libraries. Labview directly interfaces with the classes and functions defined in these libraries.

- PalmSens LabVIEW class:

    Class that implements the basic features required to use our instruments
    in LabVIEW.

    * `Initialise`: Initialises the class and .NET libraries.
    * `Dispose`: Frees up memory used by .NET libraries.
    * `ListInstruments`: Returns an array of the available instruments.
    * `Connect`: Connects to the specified instrument.
    * `Disconnect`: Disconnects from the connected instrument.
    * `Measure`: Performs a measurement.
    * `AbortMeasurement`: Aborts the current measurement

- `MeasurementResults` and `LiveCurveResults` controls: Type definitions for the in and outputs of the Measure function.

- Event Callback Vis: VIs used by the Measure function to receive data from .NET events.

## Example programs
