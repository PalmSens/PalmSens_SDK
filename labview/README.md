## SDK overview

The PalmSens SDK contains the following .NET libraries and LabVIEW
classes, controls and Vis in the PalmSens folder:

- **Libraries Folder**: Contains all the necessary .NET libraries. Labview directly interfaces with the classes and functions defined in these libraries.

- **PalmSens LabVIEW class**:

    Class that implements the basic features required to use our instruments
    in LabVIEW.

    * `Initialise`: Initialises the class and .NET libraries.
    * `Dispose`: Frees up memory used by .NET libraries.
    * `ListInstruments`: Returns an array of the available instruments.
    * `Connect`: Connects to the specified instrument.
    * `Disconnect`: Disconnects from the connected instrument.
    * `Measure`: Performs a measurement.
    * `AbortMeasurement`: Aborts the current measurement

- **`MeasurementResults` and `LiveCurveResults` controls**: Type definitions for the in and outputs of the `Measure` function.

- **Event Callback VIs**: VIs used by the Measure function to receive data from .NET events.
