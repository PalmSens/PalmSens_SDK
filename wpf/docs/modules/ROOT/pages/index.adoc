== Features

These projects contain a simplified open source wrapper for the xref:start:ROOT:core.adoc[`PalmSens.Core`] libraries.

* `PalmSens.Core.Simplified`
* `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.WPF`

The simplified wrappers give you quick and easy access to all the basic functions of the PalmSens/EmStat devices and automatically handles most potential threading issues for you:

* Connecting
* Manual control of the cell
* Running measurements
* Accessing and processing measured data
* Analyzing and manipulating data

Methods and data structures are referenced from the xref:start:ROOT:core.adoc[`PalmSens.Core`] libraries.

In addition, the projects contain a simple open source plot control that you can use to plot your measurements in real-time.
They are based on the open-source http://www.oxyplot.org/[OxyPlot library].

* `SDKPlot`
* `SDKPlot.WPF`
