image::banner.png[Banner,role=half-view-width, width=65%]

With this PalmSens SDK you develop Windows applications in Visual Studio using https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui[.NET MAUI].

..NET MAUI is a multi-platform app UI framework that lets you build native, cross-platform desktop and mobile apps with one codebase.
The PalmSens .NET MAUI SDK can be used with all PalmSens instruments and potentiostat modules.

WARNING: The .NET MAUI SDK is under active development and not ready for use. ðŸš§

Supported platforms:

* Windows
* Android (under development)
// * IOS
// * MacOS

== Contents

These projects contain an open source wrapper for the `PalmSens.Core` libraries.

* `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.NET`
* `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.MAUI`
* `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.Android`
* `PalmSens.Core.Simplified.Windows.NET`

This wrapper gives you quick and easy access to all the basic functions of the PalmSens/EmStat devices and automatically handles most potential threading issues for you:

* Connecting
* Manual control of the cell
* Running measurements
* Accessing and processing measured data
* Analyzing and manipulating data

In addition, the projects contain a simple open source plot control that you can use to plot your measurements in real-time.
They are based on the open-source http://www.oxyplot.org/[OxyPlot library].

* `SDKPlot.NET`
* `SDKPlot.Maui`

* `PalmSens.Core`
* `PalmSens.Core.Windows`

These libraries are provided as dlls and contain the namespaces with all the necessary files for using PalmSens/EmStat devices in your software.

* `PalmSens`: All necessary classes and functions for performing measurements and doing analysis with PalmSens or EmStat.
* `PalmSens.Comm`: For Serial, USB or TCP communication with PalmSens or EmStat
* `PalmSens.DataFiles`: For saving and loading method and data files
* `PalmSens.Devices`: For handling communications and device capabilities
* `PalmSens.Techniques`: Contains all measurement techniques for PalmSens and EmStat
* `PalmSens.Units`: Contains a collection of units used by these libraries
