= Example programs

This page lists some examples to help you get started with app development.

The examples use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/[asynchronous
programming] where necessary to prevent the PalmSens SDK libraries from blocking the user interface.
