%This example demonstrates how to:
%1. Load the PalmSens SDK library.
%2. Scan for connected devices using the GetConnectedDevices function.
%3. Open a connection to a device and get the comm manager that allows you
%   to communicate with the device using the OpenConnection function.
%4. Getting idle readings from the device.
%5. Close the connection to a device using its comm manager.
%6. Safely remove the connection manager from the workspace.
