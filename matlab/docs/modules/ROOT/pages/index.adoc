| **Control your PalmSens instrument using MATLAB**

Connect to your PalmSens instrument, receive data and plot the results, with a graphical user interface in MATLAB.
After selecting the electrochemical technique to use, you can adjust the parameters and start a measurement.

| **Import experimental results from PSTrace directly into MATLAB**

You can import your saved data from PSTrace in MATLAB directly.
Use the PSTrace software to set-up and run your experiments with PalmSens instruments and use MATLAB for your advanced data analyses.
