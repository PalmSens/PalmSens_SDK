"""This module contains classes for representing measurement data.

The main entry point for the data is the `Measurement` class.
These can be loaded from a .pssession file or directly returned
as a result from an expirement.

These classes are wrappers for the underlying .NET code.
Each Python wrapper in this module holds a reference to the underlying .NET SDK object,
usually prefixed `ps...` like `Measurement.psmeasurement`. These .NET classes are
instantiated by the measurement or data loading code. These wrappers are intended to
be used for data processing and exploration and not to be directly instantiated.

The raw data is stored in a `DataSet` under `Measurement.dataset`.
A _dataset_ in turn consist of a series of `DataArray`'s.
These would be analogous to the 'Data' tab in the PSTrace software.
A _data array_ would be the equivalent of a column, with a title,
array type, and units.

The `Curve` objects (retrieved via `Measurement.curves`) are interpretations
of the data, much like the plots in the PSTrace software.
These can be used for plots or data processing like smoothing the data and peak finding.
