```

[#multichannel_hw_sync]
## Multichannel HW sync

On multi-channel devices that support it, hardware sync can be used to synchronize measurements between multiple channels.
When synchronization is enabled the follower device will wait until the main channel enables synchronisation.
After that, the follower and main will synchronize their measurement loop start and iterations.

This example shows how to connect to a collection of instruments and run a chronopotentiometry measurement on all channels simultaneously using hardware synchronization.

For hardware synchronization, you set `use_hardware_sync = True` on the method.
This is the equivalent of `set_channel_sync 1` in MethodSCRIPT.
At the moment this only works with async.

In addition, your pool of instruments must contain:

* channels from a single [multi-channel instrument](https://www.palmsens.com/knowledgebase-article/multichannel-potentiostat/)
* the first (main) channel of the instrument
* at least one follower channel

All instruments are prepared and put in a waiting state.
The measurements are started via a hardware sync trigger on channel 1.
Only channel 1 (the main channel) has hardware required to trigger the other channels.

```python title="multichannel_HW_sync.py"
--8<-- "examples/multichannel_HW_sync.py"
