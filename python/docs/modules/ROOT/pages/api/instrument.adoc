= Instrument management

Use the `InstrumentManager()` to start experiments and control your
PalmSens instrument.

For example, to connect:

[,python]
----
import pypalmsens as ps

with ps.connect as manager:
        method = ps.ChronoAmperometry()
        measurement = await manager.measure(method)
----

or using `InstrumentManager()` directly as a context manager:

[,python]
----
instruments = discover()

with ps.InstrumentManager(instruments[0]) as manager:
    measurement = manager.measure(method)
----

or managing the instrument connection yourself:

[,python]
----
instruments = discover_async()

manager = ps.InstrumentManager(instruments[0])
manager.connect()
...
await manager.disconnect()
----
